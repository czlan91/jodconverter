This guide discusses migration from JODConverter version 4.1.0 version 4.1.1

## Background

The two major changes have been to set the Java baseline to Java 8 and the addition of SSL support for JODConverter
online.

## Move to Java 8 for baseline

JODConverter 4.1.1 is built using Java 8 JDK and will require Java 8 JRE at runtime (Java 9 not tested).

## JODConverter Online SSL Support

Please read the [SSL Support](https://github.com/sbraconnier/jodconverter/wiki/LibreOffice-Online#ssl-support) wiki page
section to fully understand the SSL Support.
