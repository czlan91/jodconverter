# Contributing to documentation

The JODConverter documentation is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a static site generator for project
documentation. We use the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), which started as a
simple theme for MkDocs, but became much more than that over the years. It is now a powerful documentation framework
on top of MkDocs.

[Installing Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/#installation) will
automatically install all required dependencies.
