Here are my favorite/inspiration forks/projects:

- [documents4j project](https://github.com/documents4j/documents4j): Nice choice if you want 100% perfect conversion
  using MS Office. But work only on Windows out of the box (Local implementation) and not totally free (since MS Office
  is not free). The "job" package is strongly inspired by this project.
