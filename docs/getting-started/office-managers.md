# Office Managers

This page explains what an Office Manager is in the **JODConverter** ecosystem and how it fits into conversions.

## What is an Office Manager?

In **JODConverter**, an Office Manager is the component responsible for starting, supervising, and using office
processes (LibreOffice or OpenOffice) to execute OfficeTasks such as document conversions. It provides a simple
lifecycle and a thread-safe execution API:

- **start()**: boots the underlying office process(es) and gets them ready to accept tasks.
- **execute(OfficeTask)**: submits a task and blocks until it completes.
- **stop()**: shuts down the manager and its office process(es). After `stop()`, a manager cannot be restarted.

See the interface definition:
[org.jodconverter.core.office.OfficeManager](https://github.com/jodconverter/jodconverter/blob/master/jodconverter-core/src/main/java/org/jodconverter/core/office/OfficeManager.java).

## Why do you need one?

Converters (e.g., `LocalConverter` or `RemoteConverter`) do not start OOo themselves. They delegate
to an Office Manager which maintains the connection(s) to office processes, enforces timeouts, queues tasks, and
recovers from failures.

Without an Office Manager, thereâ€™s no running office backend to perform conversions.

## Manager types

**JODConverter** ships with different Office Manager implementations depending on how and where OOo runs:

- **LocalOfficeManager**: Starts and manages one or more local office processes on the same machine as your application.
  Best for typical server-side use when OOo is installed locally.
  See [LocalOfficeManager](../configuration/local-manager.md) for all configuration options.
- **ExternalOfficeManager**: Connects to an already running local office process you start externally (you manage the
  process lifecycle). Useful when the process must be controlled outside the JVM.
  See [ExternalOfficeManager](../configuration/external-manager.md) for all configuration options.
- **RemoteOfficeManager**: Connects to a remote LibreOffice Online (LOOL/Collabora Online) server through
  HTTP/WebSocket.
  The office process lifecycle is remote; the manager controls the connection pool.
  See [RemoteOfficeManager](../configuration/remote-manager.md) for all configuration options.

Internally, pool-capable managers derive from an abstract pool (`AbstractOfficeManagerPool`) that can manage multiple
office processes simultaneously (via multiple ports or pipes) for concurrency and resilience.

## Typical usage patterns

**1)** Install a global (default) manager.

- Installing a manager in the `InstalledOfficeManagerHolder` lets converter builders use it automatically when you
  don't specify any office manager.

Java example:

```java
import org.jodconverter.core.office.OfficeException;
import org.jodconverter.core.office.OfficeUtils;
import org.jodconverter.local.LocalConverter;
import org.jodconverter.local.office.LocalOfficeManager;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws OfficeException {
    // Build and install a LocalOfficeManager as the global default
    LocalOfficeManager officeManager = LocalOfficeManager.builder().install();
    try {
      officeManager.start();

      // Now LocalConverter.make() will use the installed manager by default
      LocalConverter
          .make()
          .convert(new java.io.File("in.docx"))
          .to(new java.io.File("out.pdf"))
          .execute();

    } finally {
      OfficeUtils.stopQuietly(officeManager);
    }
  }
}
```

**2)** Pass a manager explicitly to a converter.

```java
import org.jodconverter.core.office.OfficeException;
import org.jodconverter.core.office.OfficeUtils;
import org.jodconverter.core.office.OfficeManager;
import org.jodconverter.local.LocalConverter;
import org.jodconverter.local.office.LocalOfficeManager;

OfficeManager officeManager = LocalOfficeManager.builder().build();
try {
  officeManager.start();

  LocalConverter
      .builder()
      .officeManager(officeManager)
      .build()
      .convert(new java.io.File("in.docx"))
      .to(new java.io.File("out.pdf"))
      .execute();

} finally {
  OfficeUtils.stopQuietly(officeManager);
}
```

**3)** Connect to an existing local process (`ExternalOfficeManager`).

If you start LibreOffice manually with a known accept string, use `ExternalOfficeManager`. See
configuration/external-manager.md for details.

**4)** Use a remote LibreOffice Online server (`RemoteOfficeManager`).

When targeting LO Online/Collabora Online, create a `RemoteOfficeManager` and pass it to a RemoteConverter.
See [RemoteOfficeManager](../configuration/remote-manager.md).

## Lifecycle and threading

- Start before use: Always call `start()` before invoking `execute()` through a converter.
- Stop on shutdown: Call `stop()` when your application shuts down. OfficeUtils.stopQuietly(...) is provided for
  convenience in finally blocks.
- Not restartable: Once stopped, a given manager instance cannot be restarted; create a new instance if needed.
- Thread-safe queueing: Managers queue and dispatch tasks to their office processes. Timeouts like
  `taskExecutionTimeout` and `taskQueueTimeout` protect against slow or stuck tasks
  ([see LocalOfficeManager configuration page](../configuration/local-manager.md) for more details).

## Best practices

- One manager per application: Create one `OfficeManager` and reuse it across conversions. Avoid creating a manager per
  request.
- Start early: Start the manager during application boot (e.g., in a servlet context listener or Spring Boot lifecycle)
  and stop it with a shutdown hook.
- Tune for throughput: For concurrent workloads, configure multiple ports/pipes so the manager can spawn multiple office
  processes.
- Mitigate leaks: Keep `maxTasksPerProcess` at a reasonable value so office processes are recycled periodically.
- Use the holder wisely: install() sets the `InstalledOfficeManagerHolder`; this is convenient for libraries and reduces
  boilerplate.

## Related APIs

- `OfficeManager` (core): lifecycle and execute contract.
- `InstalledOfficeManagerHolder` (core): global singleton used by converter builders when no manager is provided.
- `LocalOfficeManager` (local): starts and manages local OOo processes.
- `ExternalOfficeManager` (local): connects to an already running local office process you manage externally.
- `RemoteOfficeManager` (remote): connects to LibreOffice Online / Collabora Online.

- [ExternalOfficeManager](../configuration/external-manager.md)
- [RemoteOfficeManager](../configuration/remote-manager.md)
